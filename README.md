The gigachad way to cut a pizza!

# Background
I was inspired to make this by: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeCxjcMyY-M
Check it out to get a better idea of what this program applies to.

# Use/Purpose
The program will prompt you for the diameter of a pizza and the number of slices you wish to cut (n). 
It will then output how far one should cut parallel lines from the center of the pizza such that n slices of equal area are created.
